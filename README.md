# Troubadour
Troubadour is an application that allows you to listen to audio series, podcasts and I guess audiobooks too!

**Please note that Troubadour is at a really early stage of development and thus might be really buggy!**

## Features
- Listen to files from your computer or from the Internet
- Remembers when you stopped
- Easily get back to your last listen
- Import and export from M3U8 files!
    - Kinda limited at the moment, but definitely going to get better

## What it's made of

- NW.js for most of it (https://nwjs.io)
- Bulma for the UI (https://bulma.io/)
- Awesome Bulma themes (https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/)
- A lot of love
- Way too much time on my hands
